<h2 class="background">Process</br><small>LeanUX &amp; Collaborative design</small></h2>
<p>While I am skilled in a variety of traditional UX methods, I specialize in lean UX methods such as guerilla (or just plain quick and simple) testing, design session moderation, rapid prototyping, sketching and building collaborative relationship with project partners.</p>

<p>The biggest challenges I face and continue to find ways to overcome are wrangling old systems in to polished, usable interfaces. I seek to implement creative solutions on top of inflexible databases and legacy systems, hopefully rippling change back to the core.</p>
