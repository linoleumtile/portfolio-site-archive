title: New site using Jekyll and Github Pages
excerpt: I've never considered myself a front-end developer. But maybe today that changes, a little bit. With great direction from friend and colleague Erik Mitchell, I starting playing around with Jekyll. It took a while to get it working, but once it was, I barely had to think about it again.

#New site using Jekyll and Github Pages

I've never considered myself a front-end developer. But maybe today that changes, a little bit. With great direction from friend and colleague [Erik Mitchell](http://www.twitter.com/mitc0185), I starting playing around with Jekyll. It took a while to get it working, but once it was, I barely had to think about it again.
